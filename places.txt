Stonecrest [1] (bond) - Town where Rhian grew up

  Leela (bond) - Member of the elder council, and Rhian's mentor. Grandmother type figure, but not related by blood. One of the last surviving settlers from the Old World.
    Descriptors: Weak, skilled, charming

  Nell (bond) - Sweetheart. In a world without ironic cruelty, Rhian and Nell would almost certainly settle down and raise a family in Stonecrest. But that's not how things go in the Ironlands.
    Descriptors: Reclusive, cooperative, affectionate

Sword Ridge [2] - Nieghboring town, frequent trade partner of Stonecrest

  Nestled next to a very sharp craggy moutain, that is out of place in the southern edge of the Hinterlands.

  Random thoughts -
    * High on a solitary mountain
    * Has a good view of surrounding area, defensible
      * Does it have walls?
      * Does it rely on natural formations?
      * Does it have a particular need for defense?
    * A bit of a trade hub

F...y Valley [3]

  Rhian camped here for a night on his way to Sword Ridge, and found it unsettling. Something is here, but Rhian did not stick around long enough to find out what. Rhian does not know the name of this place (we can choose a name later). Let's make this place important later.
