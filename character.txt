Stonecrest - settlement, where Rhian grew up. Situated at the top of a cliff. Allows surveying of the various beasts in the valleys below and serves as natural fortification against enemies. But, also means no chance of retreat in case of an attack. Settlement includes high caves accessible from the top of the cliff.
