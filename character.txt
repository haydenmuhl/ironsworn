Name: Rhian
Exp: _

Edge:   1
Heart:  3
Iron:   2
Shadow: 1
Wits:   2

Assets:
    Hound, Sharp (Belloy, the goodest boy)
        When you Gather Information using your hound’s keen senses to track
        your quarry or investigate a scene, add +1 and take +1 momentum on
        a hit.
    Talisman
        When you fashion a charm, envision it and name the specific person
        or creature it protects against. Then roll +wits. On a strong hit,
        when the wearer opposes the target through a move, add +2. If a 1 is
        rolled on the action die while making a move using the charm, the
        magic is spent. On a weak hit, as above, but the wearer adds +1 when
        making a move (instead of +2).
    Herbalist
        When you attempt to Heal using herbal remedies, and you have at least
        +1 supply, you may choose one (decide before rolling).
          • Add +2.
          • On a hit, take or give an additional +1 health.

Notes:

Has Rui's iron hatchet.
Has a sling, mostly to act as a deterrant. Not considered a deadly weapon.

  - Rhian's mentor and a sort of grandmother figure
  - One of the first settlers from the Old World
