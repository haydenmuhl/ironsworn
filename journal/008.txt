    What information does Fanir tell Rhian?
      - Rui met someone recently, that she seemed to be very interested in.
      - May or may not get a name, but will definitely get a hint as to where to go next.
      - Maybe the stranger had a distinctive mark, or sigil, so I can find clues about that thing, like a tavern with that symbol over the door.
      - Maybe they carried iron. An iron amulet, which would be very decadent.

    The Conspirator
      - Wore an iron amulet of some kind of animal
        - Monstrosity: Primary Form: 59 - Insect, a dragonfly
      - Gender (1-3 male, 4-6 female: 6) female
      - Where did she travel from?
        - (1-2 Wilds, 3-4 Haven, 5-6 Tempest Hills) 6, Tempest Hills
        - She was dressed for colder weather, probably came from further north

Fanir isn't fully convinced that he will get his coat back, but sees that Rhian is not in the bargaining mood. Fanir reluctantly tells Rhian what he knows.

Rhian: "That's it? That's all you have for me?"
Fanir: "I wasn't exactly part of their conversation. Trust me, that pendant will be hard to miss. Iron is far to valuable to make jewelry out of."

Rhian turns and leaves to get some sleep. He'll need his rest for tomorrow.

Fanir: "So, that's it? What if Kiriad won't give me back what's mine?"
Rhian: "That's between you and her. I held up my end of the bargain."

Fanir's not happy, but Kiriad doesn't double cross him.

Rhian collapses onto his cot for some much needed sleep. He gets up in the morning, still sore, but rested, and goes to meet Haleema.
